Creating a *Smart Home Automation System* using *Spring Boot* involves designing a backend application ]
that communicates with IoT devices, processes data, and provides user interfaces or APIs for controlling and monitoring the system. 
Here's a step-by-step guide to building it:

 1. Define System Requirements
 Features
- Control lights, fans, thermostats, and other appliances.
- Monitor sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion).
- Schedule tasks (e.g., turn off lights at specific times).
- Real-time notifications (e.g., motion detected, high temperature).
- User authentication and authorization.

2. Architecture Design
 Core Components:
- *Spring Boot Backend*: Manages APIs, business logic, and database operations.
- *IoT Devices*: Communicates using protocols like MQTT, HTTP, or WebSockets.
- *Database*: Stores user preferences, device configurations, and logs.
- *Frontend/UI*: Web-based or mobile app (can use Angular/React or native apps).
- *Message Broker*: For real-time communication (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, or MQTT Broker).
